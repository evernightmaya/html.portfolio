<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>I am an artist who also is into roleplaying. I currently run a Fate system campaign with 3 of my other friends and 
  created a literary universe with lots of lore and information that i have developed during my childhood for years. 
  It was something I wanted to be able to pull off and express and tell the story of. Rather than being forgotten and
  loss forever , I reckoned to take the shot and did it.
</p>

<p>I also am into crypto but mostly on gaming where all my funds for living and luxury comes from. I am on the Ronin 
  Networks and I collect the premier NFT assets of the games in there and is part of the premier circles. I hope 
  to reach my goal of 1 million php sooner or later and start building from there. I've met a lot of people, rich and poor,
  local or foreign , all with their own unique stories and all tangle up into this one big community.
</p>

<p>I am currently taking this course to reinvent myself and maybe finally find my other purpose in life rather than just
  this day to day dealing with commissions and crypto.I want to be able to experience working outside , have a job and 
  get a stable income. Hopefully after this course , I'll make those come true.</p>
