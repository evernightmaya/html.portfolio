<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Maya</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Dark Knight</h3>
    <p>Good Sequel and also works as a stand alone. </p>

<h3>Avengers Infinity War</h3>
    <p>The accumulation of two decades of a cinematic universe topped off with a tragedy</p>

<h3>Edge of Tomorrow</h3>
    <p>Actually a manga adaptation of All you need is Kill. The change from the source material was nice and respectable.</p>
